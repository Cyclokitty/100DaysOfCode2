# Day 1: May 2, 2017

Began my next coding adventure!

# Day 2: May 3, 2017

**Today's Progress:**
I spent some time setting some study files for the next 100 days.
  * react
  * advancing my javascript skills, both practical and theoretical, as well as TDD, and asyn/await, and data structures and algorithms

Worked a bit on my latest React course find: [Samer Buna's React.js Getting Started](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-js-getting-started/description). So far so good. No huge projects that are semi completed to load. No huge project that doesn't give me a clue of what it's about or how or why. I had the waterfall of code that happens in most tutorials. I've only made a button that counts by one.

# Day 3: May 4, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

Worked on fcc intermediate algos and they were much easier than the first time around! So thrilled!

I'm limiting the algos to 2 a day at most so I really figure them out and understand why.

Also, worked on that pluralsight React course and it's going well. My Reac boilerplate works great. I just duplicate it in the finder window and then open it in Atom, finally yarn start in Term2.

# Day 4: May 5, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

More algos. They went really well. I need to learn more about data structures to help me with the longer, more complicated and data heavy algos. I began some data structures work: stacks. Queues are next.

Did some work on the react course. Finished my buttons. And then set up the next one about making Github cards. I've decided to go with a Toronto Blue Jays colour palette for this project. Looks nice so far.

Going to read the Facebook React docs after dinner. Mostly about props and parent/child components.

# Day 5: May 6, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

It was a miserable day for intermediate algos. It's like all my brains left for the day.

Maybe I'll have better luck with React today...

# Day 6: May 7, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

I did much better on algos today. I still need more work on summing up a primes. And what primes are.

Also, React course is going very well. I hard coded a list of github account info and displayed in cards in a div. Tomorrow I think we're going to use the actual api and using an input form to request github account users.

# Day 8: May 9, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

Good Day! I finished a couple of algos and in particular the Caesar's Cipher! It took some fiddling but I got it!

Since I learned a good amount of onClick handlers and etc in React, I'm thinking of using React to upgrade my [Scarborough Fare restaurant](https://cyclokitty.github.io/ScarboroughFare/) website.

# Day 9: May 13, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

Took a few days off for my brain to rest a bit.

Then, I worked on Reactifying my Scarborogh Fare page. So far, so good!

# Day 11: May 15, 2017

In my journey to improve my programming skills, I concentrated on algorithms.

I found a new algorithm challenge book called 'Coding Dojo' and it's pretty extensive. Even teaching code structure and Big O Notation. Just what I was looking for!

I completed chapter 1 fundamentals challenges. Glad to say they were not hard to do.

## Took some time off for some R+R. Then forgot to log my work. It was mostly algos

# Day 15: June 3, 2017

A few days ago I found johnny-five.io -- a library that lets you program Arduinos and other boards with javascript! How fun!

So, I picked up some more bits and pieces, and my Arduino kit and learned how to program leds, rgb leds, buzzers, and servos.

Today, I made a cute little rolling robot. It was very easy and loads of fun. Next, more studying of the constructors in johnny-five and build some additions to my robot.

#Day 16: June 5, 2017

Back to work! Spent my study time today working some more on data structures. Reminded myself what Stacks and Queues are and how to make a basic stack function and queue function.

Then, started in on linked lists with singly-linked list. More reading and writing tonight!

#day 17: June 6, 2017

I did more work on singly-linked lists. I'm figuring out how to write the add and search and remove methods to the object. I get lost in the currentNode and currentNode.next every time. I have a lousy sense of direction. Must keep going!

Also, thought about what other languages I should begin. Definitely Python. I love my Raspberry Pi and I'm curious to see how backend web dev works with Django and Python. As well, as fun as it is to run my Arduinos with JavaScript, I think some C++ is in order. Then Zac Cassini in FCC gitter chat said Pharo/Smalltalk is quite good for robotics. A quick google search found me a nice tut!

I have to sit myself down and not stray over to my robotics table. I really want to solder pins on those knock off arduinos!! Must do my theory work!

# Day 18: June 8, 2017

Took a day off because of a birthday and because the backyard was finally dry enough and the weather warm enough for me to clean it up.

Today, I did a good bit. First, I worked on my React project. Realized mid cup of coffee that I hadn't touched React in days. No, weeks. And since that was one of my primary goals this 100 days, I hopped to it!

Not a lot of progress since I spent much of my time reviewing my code, my outline, and remembering what I was doing. tsk. But I did get a nav list item onClick to work! yay!

Then I read some more theory and some how that led to the differences between objects and classes in JavaScript, which led to how classes in js aren't true OOP language style objects. More looking around brought me to factory functions. Which I have to say look and feel much nicer than using this.whatevs and .bind and .call and .apply.

Here's a smidge:

```

// factory function example
const dog = (name) => {
  const sound = 'woof';
  const pooped = false;
  return {
    talk: () => {
      return sound;
    },
    poop: (bool) => {
      if (bool === true) {
        return `${name} had a great poop!`;
      } else if (bool === false) {
        return `${name} has not pooped :(`;
      } else if (bool !== true || bool !== false) {
        return null;
      }
   },
   play: (game) => {
     return `${name} wants to play ${game}`;
   },
   eat: (food) => {
     return `${name}, time to eat ${food} for dinner`;
   }
  };
};

const barker = dog("Barker");
barker.talk();
barker.poop(true);
barker.play('fetch');
barker.eat('yummy kibble');
barker.play('tug of war');

```

Not a great example but worth practicing and working on some more.

# Day 19: June 9, 2017

Today was Soldering Day! Finished the first part of my how-to-soldering kit and did a really crappy soldering together of a battery plug and male end of jumper wires. It does work, mind you. I checked with my voltage meter.

More soldering tomorrow. At least I remembered to buy a lighter for the shrink wrap.

Completed 7 Bug-Ridden 13 algos from Coding Dojo algo book.

They were fun.

Still to do, read a bit about [memory leaks in javascript](https://auth0.com/blog/four-types-of-leaks-in-your-javascript-code-and-how-to-get-rid-of-them/).

# Day 20: June 10, 2017

completed the rest of chapter 5's bug ridden 13 algos from coding dojo book.

# Day 21: June 11, 2017

Worked on recursion, memory leaks in js, and worked on a sensor in c++.

Sensor works! Next time, get it working with javascript.

The knock off arduino nano set up drove me spare. I thought it was a 328. Spent an hour trying to make it work until I said 'ah, heck. let me try selecting 128 instead'. Bzz bng bmp. It worked! I made an led light up. I then tried out the code for the proximity sensor and two leds. The tiny nano already has the pins attached (yeah!) and it is best if I set that on a tiny breadboard and have a 1/2 breadboard for the sensor, leds, resistors, and jumpers. Everything worked really well!

# Day 22: June 12, 2017

A bit of a lazy day because I slept poorly last night. I rallied in the afternoon and explored recursion some more. One thing about recursion: it is really cool but not always the best solution.

Then, I researched robots that can follow. Quite neat! It's the opposite of avoidance robots (planning to make) that skirt past obstructions. The follow bots actually tag along with you. Lots of ways to do. I'd like one that stays close to me with the proximity sensor. Other versions use RFIDs or remotes. Remotes are ok but not really a true follow bot. RFID comes close since it won't confuse the arrival of another person like with a proximity sensor.

# Day 23: June 13, 2017

A bit of recursion but mostly it was about my robot.

Played some more with arduino and johnny-five. And enjoyed watching some videos about a cooler that can follow someone and several nerf gun mods.

# Day 24: June 14, 2017

So, I learned today never ever just pick some trim pot out of your electronics supply kit and willy-nilly shove it into your breadboard.

I have a wrecked breadboard.

I did eventually get the lcd screen working with johnny-five and node.

I'm still not getting the right order and timing of commands. I'm making a magic8ball bot and the script immediately runs the button click before the button is ever clicked.

Then I found out the little Nano's do not have enough memory to run the standard firmata to run johnny-five. sigh. I'll keep those for the khan academy c++ spider bot project as originally planned.

Tomorrow, solder practice. I need to solder the header pins to the mkr1000.

#Day 25, 2017: June 15, 2017

Completed my magic8ball arduino project! It was fun. My afternoon nap went too long so my robot will have to wait for Saturday. That's ok. I want to solder male jumpers to the end of the 4AA battery case.

I organized some of my electronics parts. I'm getting quite the little collection and they need some organizing. I don't want to either lose some or keep buying the same parts. There's only X amount of money in the hobby kitty.

...

A kitty! I can make a robot kitty!! Nice!

And for reasons that escape me, I signed up for the hackerrank contest for a free tshirt. I have a few days to cram much algorthim scripting into my skull.

#Day 26, 2017: June 16, 2017

A reading day because I was out of town. I returned to Dr. Fisby's functional programming book. I understand it more. Looking forward to trying out the examples in the book.

Then, read some Arudino programming. It's basically C++ modified a bit. I'm returning to CS50 this week because it teaches C which is close enough to C++. I like using js with my arduino but I can see myself going back and forth between js and C++ depending on the libraries I find for the aruduinos.

Also decided to stick with the Arduino made arduinos.

#Day 27, 2017: June 17, 2017

Spent the afternoon napping and soldering. I did not nap duing the soldering. That would end badly. I finished the starter project -- it worked on the first attempt! My solders still look crummy but I ordered some printed circuit boards(pcb) for practicing. I should also order more wire and solder.

Working on the hackerrank beginner challenges. They are easy so far. It's more a matter of figuring out how they want the answer because it gets re-formatted for testing.

Read more of my data structures book. Need to try out the examples and make notes.

# Day 28: June 20, 2017

Took a couple of rest days to catch up on some socializing and house cleaning.

Worked on my arduino uno and johnny-five. Figured out how to (more or less) get wire 8 leds and get them to turn on and then off in sequence. Still needs some polishing. Made a video of it. I need to start gathering these videos up and posting to a blog on my portfolio page.

#Day 29: June 23, 2017

Ok, slow week. Mostly I played with my arduino. Then found some neat tut videos on how to make walking robots using small motors and cardboard/popsicle sticks. Amazing how addictive these are. I'm working on my first walking robot today out of foam-core. I hope the foam-core isn't too light. We shall soon find out.

Then, I completed a neat algo: if a-z has a scoring of 1-26, find the word with the highest score in a sentence. Yeah, got it! And it was fun.

Later today, I'm working on my React project, Scarborough Fare restaurant. I've neglected it. I'm committing to a week of non-stop React! Ok, not non-stop but definitely an hour each day.

On the topic of React, I found in an article a React static site generator called Gatsby.js. I'm gonna play with it over the next few days. Looks like a good project.

As of today, 377 people downloaded my cat-namer npm library! Neat! I should add some new names. Maybe some new method? Need to think about what.

And now, to assemble my walking robot! Once I have it working, I want to make another that can avoid obstacles using a simple antenna and an extra motor to pivot it away from the obstacle. Even better, I will decorate it to look like [Snidely Whiplash](https://media.giphy.com/media/q6DIGejB7Dypi/giphy.gif).

Ok, foam-core for robot material --- BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD! Don't do it.

Alrighty, back to the plans.

I need more cardboard.

#Day 30: June 24, 2017

Bought some extra supplies for the bot:
  * super glue
  * two sizes of kebab sticks

Found a couple of sheets of cardboard.

Everything was going well. I drew out the pieces. Cut them out. Began gluing. Then, started assembling the body.

Then I smashed my bad word finger in between the scissors grips while trimming the kebab sticks. Bad move. I now have a bruised nail bed. I decided to put things away.
