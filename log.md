# Day 1: May 2, 2017

Began my next coding adventure!

# Day 2: May 3, 2017

**Today's Progress:**
I spent some time setting some study files for the next 100 days.
  * react
  * advancing my javascript skills, both practical and theoretical, as well as TDD, and asyn/await, and data structures and algorithms

Worked a bit on my latest React course find: [Samer Buna's React.js Getting Started](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-js-getting-started/description). So far so good. No huge projects that are semi completed to load. No huge project that doesn't give me a clue of what it's about or how or why. I had the waterfall of code that happens in most tutorials. I've only made a button that counts by one.

# Day 3: May 4, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

Worked on fcc intermediate algos and they were much easier than the first time around! So thrilled!

I'm limiting the algos to 2 a day at most so I really figure them out and understand why.

Also, worked on that pluralsight React course and it's going well. My Reac boilerplate works great. I just duplicate it in the finder window and then open it in Atom, finally yarn start in Term2.

# Day 4: May 5, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

More algos. They went really well. I need to learn more about data structures to help me with the longer, more complicated and data heavy algos. I began some data structures work: stacks. Queues are next.

Did some work on the react course. Finished my buttons. And then set up the next one about making Github cards. I've decided to go with a Toronto Blue Jays colour palette for this project. Looks nice so far.

Going to read the Facebook React docs after dinner. Mostly about props and parent/child components.

# Day 5: May 6, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

It was a miserable day for intermediate algos. It's like all my brains left for the day.

Maybe I'll have better luck with React today...

# Day 6: May 7, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

I did much better on algos today. I still need more work on summing up a primes. And what primes are.

Also, React course is going very well. I hard coded a list of github account info and displayed in cards in a div. Tomorrow I think we're going to use the actual api and using an input form to request github account users.

# Day 7: May 8, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

Worked on functional programming and a bit on React.

# Day 8: May 9, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

Good Day! I finished a couple of algos and in particular the Caesar's Cipher! It took some fiddling but I got it!

Since I learned a good amount of onClick handlers and etc in React, I'm thinking of using React to upgrade my [Scarborough Fare restaurant](https://cyclokitty.github.io/ScarboroughFare/) website.

# Day 9: May 13, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

Took a few days off for my brain to rest a bit.

Then, I worked on Reactifying my Scarborogh Fare page. So far, so good!

# Day 10: May 14, 2017

Short day because it is Sunday. But I did complete one of the advanced Algos and I'm rather thrilled with myself! Yeah, me!

# Day 11: May 15, 2017

In my journey to improve my programming skills, I concentrated on algorithms.

I found a new algorithm challenge book called 'Coding Dojo' and it's pretty extensive. Even teaching code structure and Big O Notation. Just what I was looking for!

I completed chapter 1 fundamentals challenges. Glad to say they were not hard to do.

## Took some time off for some R+R. Then forgot to log my work. It was mostly algos

# Day 15: June 3, 2017

A few days ago I found johnny-five.io -- a library that lets you program Arduinos and other boards with javascript! How fun!

So, I picked up some more bits and pieces, and my Arduino kit and learned how to program leds, rgb leds, buzzers, and servos.

Today, I made a cute little rolling robot. It was very easy and loads of fun. Next, more studying of the constructors in johnny-five and build some additions to my robot.

#Day 16: June 5, 2017

Back to work! Spent my study time today working some more on data structures. Reminded myself what Stacks and Queues are and how to make a basic stack function and queue function.

Then, started in on linked lists with singly-linked list. More reading and writing tonight!

#day 17: June 6, 2017

I did more work on singly-linked lists. I'm figuring out how to write the add and search and remove methods to the object. I get lost in the currentNode and currentNode.next every time. I have a lousy sense of direction. Must keep going!

Also, thought about what other languages I should begin. Definitely Python. I love my Raspberry Pi and I'm curious to see how backend web dev works with Django and Python. As well, as fun as it is to run my Arduinos with JavaScript, I think some C++ is in order. Then Zac Cassini in FCC gitter chat said Pharo/Smalltalk is quite good for robotics. A quick google search found me a nice tut!

I have to sit myself down and not stray over to my robotics table. I really want to solder pins on those knock off arduinos!! Must do my theory work!

# Day 18: June 8, 2017

Took a day off because of a birthday and because the backyard was finally dry enough and the weather warm enough for me to clean it up.

Today, I did a good bit. First, I worked on my React project. Realized mid cup of coffee that I hadn't touched React in days. No, weeks. And since that was one of my primary goals this 100 days, I hopped to it!

Not a lot of progress since I spent much of my time reviewing my code, my outline, and remembering what I was doing. tsk. But I did get a nav list item onClick to work! yay!

Then I read some more theory and some how that led to the differences between objects and classes in JavaScript, which led to how classes in js aren't true OOP language style objects. More looking around brought me to factory functions. Which I have to say look and feel much nicer than using this.whatevs and .bind and .call and .apply.

Here's a smidge:

```

// factory function example
const dog = (name) => {
  const sound = 'woof';
  const pooped = false;
  return {
    talk: () => {
      return sound;
    },
    poop: (bool) => {
      if (bool === true) {
        return `${name} had a great poop!`;
      } else if (bool === false) {
        return `${name} has not pooped :(`;
      } else if (bool !== true || bool !== false) {
        return null;
      }
   },
   play: (game) => {
     return `${name} wants to play ${game}`;
   },
   eat: (food) => {
     return `${name}, time to eat ${food} for dinner`;
   }
  };
};

const barker = dog("Barker");
barker.talk();
barker.poop(true);
barker.play('fetch');
barker.eat('yummy kibble');
barker.play('tug of war');

```

Not a great example but worth practicing and working on some more.
