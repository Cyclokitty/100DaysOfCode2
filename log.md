# Day 1: May 2, 2017

Began my next coding adventure!

# Day 2: May 3, 2017

**Today's Progress:**
I spent some time setting some study files for the next 100 days.
  * react
  * advancing my javascript skills, both practical and theoretical, as well as TDD, and asyn/await, and data structures and algorithms

Worked a bit on my latest React course find: [Samer Buna's React.js Getting Started](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-js-getting-started/description). So far so good. No huge projects that are semi completed to load. No huge project that doesn't give me a clue of what it's about or how or why. I had the waterfall of code that happens in most tutorials. I've only made a button that counts by one.

# Day 3: May 4, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

Worked on fcc intermediate algos and they were much easier than the first time around! So thrilled!

I'm limiting the algos to 2 a day at most so I really figure them out and understand why.

Also, worked on that pluralsight React course and it's going well. My Reac boilerplate works great. I just duplicate it in the finder window and then open it in Atom, finally yarn start in Term2.
